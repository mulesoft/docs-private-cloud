To ensure the performance and stability of Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition (Anypoint Platform PCE), every node in your Anypoint Platform PCE environment must meet the software prerequisites described in this topic:

* Operating system (OS) prerequisites
* Third-party software prerequisites
* MuleSoft software prerequisites

[IMPORTANT]
Before you install Anypoint Platform PCE, your infrastructure team must review each of the following sections and verify that your environment meets the stated software requirements. If needed, contact your MuleSoft representative for assistance.

== Operating System Prerequisites

=== Verify Linux Distribution
The following Linux distributions are supported:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.8, 7.9, 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3
* CentOS 7.8, 7.9, 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3

=== Check for SELinux Custom Profiles
Although SELinux is not required, Anypoint Platform PCE supports the default SELinux profile running 
in strict mode. If your environment uses a custom profile, it must provide an unconstrained user context when 
running the installer. Review any custom profiles with your MuleSoft representative.

=== Enable and Load Kernel Modules

You must enable the following kernel modules on each node:

* `br_netfilter`
* `ebtable_filter`
* `ip_tables`
* `iptable_filter`
* `iptable_nat`
* `overlay`

For each kernel module, run a command similar to the following example to verify that each module is loaded. Replace `br_netfilter` with the name of the kernel module you are checking:

----
root$ lsmod | grep br_netfilter
----

* If this command does not display any output, then the module is not loaded. In this case, load the module using `modprobe`:
+
----
root$ modprobe br_netfilter
----

Ensure a module is loaded after a reboot by using the following command:

----
root$ echo 'br_netfilter' > /etc/modules-load.d/br_netfilter.conf
----

=== Verify Kernel Settings

The following flags must be enabled:

* `net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1`
* `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`
* `fs.may_detach_mounts=1`
* `fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288`

Ensure that no processes on your system set this flag to `false`. To set a parameter, use `sysctl -w`, as shown in the following example:

----
root$ sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
----

To make the changes permanent for the next reboot, write the changes to a file under `/etc/sysctl.d`. Replace the setting in the following example with the setting you are configuring.

----
echo net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 >> /etc/sysctl.d/10-ipv4-forwarding.conf
----

Ensure that no processes or files conflict with those settings.

== Third Party Software Prerequisites

=== Install LVM2

To install and run Anypoint Platform PCE, you must install and use Logical Volume Manager 2 (LVM2). LVM2 is a tool that adds a layer of abstraction between your operating system and the disks and partitions it uses. You must have root access to install LVM2.

You can install LVM2 using Yum. Yum is an open-source command-line package-management utility for Linux operating systems using the RPM Package Manager. Using Yum, you can install LVM2 using the following command:

----
sudo yum install lvm2
----

=== Requirements When Firewalld Is Enabled

Firewalld is an iptables controller that defines rules for persistent network traffic.
If you are using firewalld with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.3 operating system, you must enable forwarding on the `docker0` device.
You must also forward any packets being sent from or to the 10.0.0.0/8 subnet.


==== Determine If You Are Using Firewalld

To determine if your system is using firewalld, run the following command on every node:

----
systemctl status firewalld.service
----

If firewalld is installed, the following output is displayed:

----
$ sudo systemctl status firewalld.service
* firewalld.service - firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/firewalld.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
Active: inactive (dead)
Docs: man:firewalld(1)
----

If firewalld is not installed, an error message is displayed.

==== Enable Forwarding on Docker Device

To enable forwarding on the docker0 device, run the following commands:

----
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter FORWARD 1 -o docker0 -j ACCEPT -m comment --comment "docker subnet"

firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter FORWARD 1 -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j ACCEPT -m comment --comment "docker subnet"
----

To enable forwarding on the 10.0.0.0/8 subnet, run the following commands:

----
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 1 -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j ACCEPT -m comment --comment "docker subnet"

firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 1 -d 10.0.0.0/8 -j ACCEPT -m comment --comment "docker subnet"
----

=== Remove Local DNS Servers

Remove local caching DNS servers listening on port 53, for example, `named`, `dnsmasq`, and `bind`.

=== Install Required Tools

* Tool to Verify NFS Server Ports are Open
+
Netcat is recommended, but you can use your tool of choice to verify the correct ports are open on the NFS server. If you do not have `netcat`, you can install it from  http://netcat.sourceforge.net/download.php or follow the instructions at https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/install-use-netcat-command-linux/.

=== Remove Server Configuration Management Software

Any Server Configuration Management software, such as Puppet, Chef, Ansible, and SaltStack, must be removed.
This software usually changes kernel modules and settings that are required, and can also restart servers without following the correct shut down procedure, causing the system to enter a failed state.

== MuleSoft Software Prerequisites

=== Obtain Install Archive and License Key
 
Obtain the installer archive (`anypoint-2.1.x-installer.tar.gz`) and license key from your MuleSoft account representative.

=== Verify IP Forwarding and Bridging

To ensure proper cluster load balancing and routing, you must enable, correctly configure, and verify the following items:

* Kernel IP forwarding
+
To enable internal Kubernetes load balancing, you must enable IPv4 forwarding on all servers.
* Bridge-netfilter
+
Enable the Linux kernel to translate packets to and from hosted containers.

** IP addresses for bridge-netfiltering are managed by the overlay network created by Kubernetes. Verify that the CIDR block used for that network is in the private IP address range.

== Verify SSL Certificate Requirements

To use the Anypoint Platform PCE, you must provide SSL certificates. You can upload 
a certificate through the Anypoint Platform PCE UI. This certificate must be trusted by every machine that is 
connected to the platform.

[WARNING]
You must register the same SSL certificate on every node containing Mule runtime engines managed by your installation.

=== Uninstall Unsupported Software

Some software causes conflicts with Anypoint Platform PCE. You must uninstall this software before performing Anypoint Platform PCE installation.

==== Docker

Uninstall Docker from all servers running the Anypoint Platform PCE. The Anypoint Platform PCE installation includes a Docker package officially supported by Kubernetes.
