= To Install Anypoint Private Cloud using the GUI Installer

This topic describes how to run the GUI-based installer for Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition. This installer provides a wizard that walks you through the process of configuring much of the infrastructure required to run Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition. It automatically installs Kubernetes and creates multiple Docker containers that host the platform components.
// Why not move port info to this install topic if only needed here???
// This makes it sound like the CLI install is lacking something. I think this needs to be reworded a bit, and reasons for using the GUI vs CLI spelled out.???

== Prerequisites

Before running the installer, ensure that your system meets the minimum system requirements.

The installer automatically validates requirements for disk space, disk speed, network speed and operating system version. You must run the installer in a single session without interruption. Restarting the installer may cause problems with the installation.

Anypoint Private Cloud, version 2.0 requires that you have an NFS server installed and configured. Ensure that this is installed before beginning. See xref:prereq-network.adoc[Private Cloud Edition Network Requirements]

== Running the Installer

. Obtain the `anypoint-2.0.0-installer.tar.gz` archive from your customer success representative.
// Where do I put the gzip archive???

. Uncompress the gzip archive:
+
----
tar xvf anypoint-2.0.0-installer.tar.gz
----

. From the location where you unzipped the archive, run the following command:
+
----
./install
----
+

. Select the IP address you want to use and confirm.
// How do I know what IP addresses to use for {HOSTS} and {TOKENS} ??? From partner: The GUI install script has the request for an Install token yet there is no other reference anywhere else to what that is or where it comes from.  Can you provide additional information?

+
Based on your selection, the installer displays a message similar to the following:
+
----
OPEN THIS IN BROWSER: https://{HOST}:61009/web/installer/new/gravitational.io/anypoint/{VERSION}?install_token={TOKEN}
----

. Open this URL in a browser.
+
The installer runs on an internal IP that you can use to access from within your network. To access the URL from outside the network you must replace the hostname in the URL with a public IP address.
+
After launching the installation wizard, perform the following steps to install Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.
// How do I launch the install wizard?

. Enter your Anypoint Platform license key, then click *Continue*.
// Does PCE use the same license as Mule Runtime? Assumption is yes.
+
You must obtain the license key from your MuleSoft account representative. After applying a new license, it may take time for the installer to recognize the license.
// How can I find out who the MuleSoft account rep is? And do I need to provide any information to the rep???

. Enter a name for your cluster deployment.
+
This name should be unique to your company. For example: `anypoint.yourcompany`. The name you provide here does not change the network address or organization name in Anypoint Platform.

. Choose a provider, then click Continue.

. Using the slider, select the number of server nodes you want to create.
+
The following configurations are supported:
+
	* 1-node configuration: installs all platform components run on a single node. This configuration is intended for demo purposes only and has lower hardware requirements. It is not supported for development or production environments. The demo installation includes its own LDAP server to use for testing.
	//There was feedback that indicated this didn't work.???
	* 3-node configuration: installs and registers all servers as *General Purpose Nodes*.
	* 6-node configuration: installs and registers three nodes as *App-only* and three nodes as *Data Store*.
+
Depending on the number of nodes you select, the installer displays one or more `curl` commands.

. Run the `curl command from the command line of each node in your installation.
+
If you are running a 3-node configuration, you must Run the same command on each server in your environment. If you are running a 6-node configuration, you must run different `curl` commands on the app and data nodes.
+
You must have administrator privileges to run this command. The command should have the following structure, but varies depending on the selected installation flavor you select and the type of the node:
+
----
curl -s --tlsv1.2 --insecure "https://{HOST}:443/t/{TOKEN}/node" | sudo bash
----
+
[WARNING]
If you are running the command above from an SSH session, ensure the session does not time out during installation or the installer will fail. Using `nohup` and `&` at the end, e.g. `sudo nohup bash &` will make the process to start in the background and will keep running if your ssh session expires.
Using `screen` or `tmux` is another alternative that keeps you process running if your ssh-session ends.
+
After running the `curl` command on a node, the node appears in the installer UI.

. Click Verify, to ensure that each of your servers meets the minimum disk and system requirements.
+
This may take a few minutes to complete. If you system meets all of the requirements, the installer displays a green check mark.

. Select an IP address from the drop-down list.
// Select IP address from drop-down list - any guidance???
+
This IP address is used to communicate within the cluster.

. Choose a Docker device from the drop-down list, or manually specify the path to your own. Ensure that on each of your nodes, both devices are configured with enough space.
//Choose Docker device - any guidance? I thought Docker was uninstalled, why would there be anything listed here? How do I find the path to my own Docker device? How do I know if there’s enough space???
+
This is the device Docker uses for volume management.

. Enter the location where Anypoint Platform data is stored.
// How can I find out where Anypoint platform data is stored if it’s not the default? How much is enough disk space???
+
This is the location of the databases and object stores. By default, this location is `/var/lib/data`. You must ensure that the location you specify has enough disk space.

. After all nodes are visible and configured, click Start Installation.
+
The installer passes through several different stages. Wait for this process to finish.

. Enter the following information about your organization and Anypoint Platform administrator:
+
* Organization name
* Administrator email
* Administrator username
* Administrator password
+
//Should org name be the same as cluster deployment???

Platform users access their accounts based on the organization name that you provide here or a business group within it.

. Enter the following information about your NFS server:
// How do I get these???
+
* NFS Server
* NFS Path
