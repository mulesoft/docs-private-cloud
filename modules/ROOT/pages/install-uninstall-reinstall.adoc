If you encounter problems during installation, you can attempt to reinstall. Before beginning a new install, ensure that all remnants of the original installation have been removed by performing the following commands on all nodes:

Uninstall Gravity
----
# The order of the following steps is important!
# Perform each step in order as described.

# Remove installed system components.
sudo gravity system uninstall --confirm

# Unmount all anypoint mounts.
sudo umount /var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd
sudo umount /var/lib/gravity
sudo umount /var/lib/data

# Remount and clear platform data.
sudo mount /var/lib/gravity
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/gravity/*

# Remount and clear platform data.
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd
sudo mount /var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd/*

# Remount and clear application data.
sudo mount /var/lib/data
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/data/*
----

Restore Original State of the Docker Volume
----
# In order to clean the Docker volumes, you might need to first reboot the server 
# to force clean down any handles to the Docker Device.
# This allows you to perform the proper clean-up.

# Identify whether the docker logical volume was created.
sudo lvs | grep docker
# If the volume exists, remove it.
sudo lvremove docker

# Identify whether the docker volume group was created.
sudo vgs | grep docker
# If the volume exists, remove it.
sudo vgremove docker

# Identify whether the docker physical volume was created.
sudo pvs | grep docker
# If the volume exists, remove it.
sudo pvremove <PV Name>

# Clean the docker device by replacing "{docker-device}" in the following command:
sudo parted /dev/{docker-device} mklabel gpt -s
----

Purge IPTABLES
----
# List iptables.
sudo iptables -L -n -v

# Delete any entries.
sudo iptables -F
sudo iptables -X

# Flush nat IP table.
sudo iptables -t nat -F
sudo iptables -t nat -X

# Flush filter IP table.
sudo iptables -t filter -F
sudo iptables -t filter -X
----

Depending on the state of the full or partial install that you are replacing, the previous commands might not 
completely return the system to an installable state. Before beginning reinstallation, ensure that your system 
is still set up correctly and meets the minimum disk and resource requirements.
