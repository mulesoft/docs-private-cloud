= Private Cloud Edition Network Requirements

The this topic describes the network requirements for running Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

== Static IPs

All servers in the cluster should have static private IPv4 assigned to them, these must persist after server 
restarts. If IP addresses are not persistent between reboots, the cluster may enter a failed state.

== VXLAN

The version of Kubernetes supported by Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition uses an overlay VXLAN and UDP 
transport to encapsulate traffic. There is direct communication between components of the cluster. The table 
below shows the ports used for inter-host communication. You must ensure that all of these ports are 
configured correctly.

== NAT Traffic Requirements

In some situation, the Kubernetes overlay network uses NAT. NAT requires that servers be able to send and 
receive packages with a source and destination that is different from the serverâ€™s internal IP.

Any software that monitors the network traffic must be tuned to allow this type of network interaction.

== SSL Certificate Requirements

In order to use the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, you must provide SSL credentials. You can upload 
a certificate through the Anypoint Platform UI. This certificate must be trusted by every machine that is 
connected to the platform.

[WARNING]
You must register the same SSL certificate on every server containing Mule Runtimes managed by your installation.

== SMTP Server Requirements

Your network must include an SMTP server to manage e-mail alerts that are triggered by the platform.

== External Identity Provider and Client Management 

To configure an Exernal Identity Provider for users single sign on (LDAP, OpenID, SAML) or for external 
client management as OpenID Connect, the cluster must be able to access the External Identity Provider endpoint. 

== IP Forwarding and Bridging

To ensure proper cluster load balancing and routing, you must enable and correctly configure the following:

* Kernel IP forwarding: to enable internal Kubernetes load balancing you must enable IPv4 forwarding on all servers.
* Bridge-netfilter: enables the Linux kernel to translate packets to and from hosted containers.

** IP addresses for bridge-netfiltering are managed by the overlay network created by Kubernetes. The CIDR block used for that network is in the private IP address range.
