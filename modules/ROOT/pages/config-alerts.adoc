Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition (Anypoint Platform PCE) provides built-in alerts that are triggered when a condition specified in any alert definition is detected.

Measurements are stored in https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview[Influxdb] and read by https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/kapacitor[Kapacitor]. Kapacitor sends emails when an alert is triggered.

== Alert Definitions

[%header%autowidth.spread]
.Alert Definitions
|===
| Name | Description | Threshold | Config map
| High CPU | Measures the total CPU usage on all cluster nodes | Warning 75%, Critical 90% | kapacitor-alerts 
| High Memory | Measures the memory consumption on all cluster nodes | Warning 75%, Critical 90% | kapacitor-alerts 
| Filesystem Usage	| Measures the file system usage | Warning 80%, Critical 90% | kapacitor-alerts 
| Kubernetes Node Status | Checks Kubernetes status for all nodes| When Kubernetes reports a `NotReady` node status | kapacitor-alerts 
| Etcd Latency | Measures the latency between nodes, which can affect `etcd` performance | Warning 521 seconds, Critical 1024 seconds | kapacitor-alerts 
| Systemd health | Checks if the `systemd` slice (where gravity is running) is healthy | When gravity or child systems, such as `docker`, `etcd`, `kube-proxy`, `kube-kubelet`, `planet-agent`, `dnsmasq`, and `flanneld`, are down | kapacitor-alerts 
| Influxdb Healthcheck Status | Checks the health of `Influxdb` (where the metrics for monitoring are stored) | No connection to `Influxdb` | kapacitor-alerts 
| Networking Configuration | Checks networking operating system flag status | When `ip_forward` or `br_netfilter` flags are disabled | kapacitor-alerts 
| Node Uptime | Checks if nodes are online | When a node is down for more than five minutes | kapacitor-alerts 
| Etcd Health | Check the status of `etcd` | When `etcd` is down or not healthy | kapacitor-alerts 
| Docker Status	| Verifies that the docker service is running on each node | When docker service is not running on a node | kapacitor-alerts 
| Backup Failing | Checks the result of a backup operation | When a backup operation fails | backup-status-alert
| Stolon Replication Lag | Verifies that `Postgres` replicas are in sync | When a replica is lagging by 1800 or more seconds | kapacitor-alerts 
| Cassandra Load | Verifies that Cassandra nodes are in sync | Warning 10% difference, Critical 20% difference | cassandra-load
|===

== Configure Alert Definitions 

. From OpsCenter, navigate to *Configuration*.
. Select the *monitoring* namespace.
. Select a config map and apply your changes.

If you apply changes to the `kapacitor-alerts` config map, you must restart Kapacitor. Follow the instructions in the Restart Kapacitor section.

== Configure Alerts

. Configure the `FROM` and `TO` email addresses:
.. Log in to the Ops Center console and then select *Configuration*.
.. From the *Namespace* drop-down list, select *monitoring*.
.. From the *Config maps* drop-down list, select *alerting-addresses*.
.. Select *From* and then enter the `FROM` email address used for the alert.
.. Select *To* and then enter the `TO` email address used for the alert.

. Configure your SMTP email server to send alerts.
+
Configuring the SMTP server in Anypoint Access Management restarts the Anypoint Platform service responsible for initiating alerts.
. Verify alerts configuration:
+
** Verify that your SMTP server can send and receive emails using the addresses you configure as the `FROM` and `TO` addresses in the following section.
** Verify that your cluster nodes can communicate with your SMTP server.
+
For example, use `telnet` to connect to your SMTP server from one of your cluster nodes:
+
----
telnet my.smtp.server.com 587
Trying XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX...
Connected to my.smtp.server.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 my.smtp.server.com ESMTP
^[^]
telnet> quit
Connection closed.
----

== Troubleshooting

If the connection is working, you can check Kapacitor logs for other errors when sending email alerts. 
On Ops Center, you can retrieve log information in the console output by running the following command: 
----
kubectl logs -n monitoring -l component=kapacitor -c kapacitor
----

== Restart Kapacitor
When you change the SMTP settings from Access Management, Kapacitor is automatically restarted to include the updated settings. 

If you change an alert definition or the `alerting-addresses` config map without changing the SMTP settings from Access Management, Kapacitor must be manually restarted:

. Open a terminal to one of the master servers.
. Run the following command:
+
```
`kubectl delete pod -n monitoring -l component=kapacitor`
```
. Wait for a `kapacitor` pod to run. Run the following command for verification:
+
```
kubectl get pod -n monitoring -l component=kapacitor` 
```
