== Before You Begin
Because Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition (Anypoint Platform PCE) upgrades require a working installation, all environment prerequisites should already be met. As long as you (or your infrastructure team) successfully performed all prerequisite tasks listed in xref:prereq-hardware.adoc[Hardware Prerequisites], xref:prereq-software.adoc[Software Prerequisites], and xref:prereq-network.adoc[Network Prerequisites] prior to the installation of Anypoint Platform PCE, your environment can be upgraded successfully.

Refer to the xref:release-notes::pce/anypoint-private-cloud-release-notes.adoc[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition Release Notes] for additional information about upgrading Anypoint Platform PCE to the most recent version.

[WARNING]
You must contact MuleSoft professional services prior to upgrading. MuleSoft professional services must be involved with your upgrade procedure. 

== Procedure

The following steps describe how to upgrade Anypoint Platform PCE and the Anypoint Platform PCE infrastructure from v2.0.x to v2.1.0. 

If you are upgrading from a prior version of Anypoint Platform PCE, you must first upgrade to v2.0.4 and then upgrade to v2.1.0. 

[NOTE]
====
* During an upgrade, all Anypoint Platform PCE components are updated.
* The upgrade process causes downtime for each node as it is updated.
====

. Perform a backup of your system as described in xref:backup-and-disaster-recovery.adoc[Configure Backup and Restore]. If you are upgrading from an older version that requires multiple intermediate upgrades, you must backup each intermediate version before proceeding to the next.

. Verify that there is adequate disk space available for the upgrade, which is at least half the amount specified in xref:prereq-hardware.adoc[Hardware Prerequisites]. For example, for `/var/lib/gravity`, the recommended amount of disk space is 100Gb, so ensure that you have 50Gb of available space. Run the following command to check the amount of available space:
+
----
df -h /var/lib/gravity/
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/nvme0n1p2  200G   66G  135G  33% /
----
+
If you do not have enough available space, run the garbage collection command, pointing to the `gravity` binary from the new installer:
+
----
sudo ./gravity gc
----
+ 
If running the garbage collection does not free up enough space, you must extend the disks before performing the upgrade.

. Obtain a link to the installer from your customer success representative.

. Use `ssh` to log in to the master node of your cluster.
+
In a 3-node environment, all nodes are master nodes. To find the master nodes in a 6-node environment, run the following command:
+
----
kubectl get node --show-labels | grep gravitational.io/k8s-role=master
----
+
By performing these procedures from the master node, the upgrade scripts are able to update the entire platform.

. Verify that there is adequate space available in the path where you plan to download the new installer file.

. Create a new folder and untar the new installer:
+
----
mkdir anypoint-2.1.0-installer && tar -xvf anypoint-2.1.0-installer.tar.gz -C anypoint-2.1.0-installer
----

. Navigate to the `anypoint-2.1.0-installer` directory and run the upload script:
+
----
cd anypoint-2.1.0-installer
sudo ./upgrade
----
+
The `sudo ./upgrade` command updates the platform to the current version and restarts each pod in the cluster. Depending on your network configuration, this command may take a while to complete, and produces output similar to the following example:
+

----

. When the upgrade finishes, verify that the migration was successful by checking that all pods are running:
+
----
$ sudo gravity enter
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
----

. Open the new `8083` port on your load balancer and map it to the `30883` port on your servers. Refer to the 2.1 xref:prereq-hardware.adoc[Hardware Prerequisities] section for more information.

. Reconfigure DNS to trigger the creation of certificates for the new Runtime Manager services. If the DNS setting already has the desired value, copy and paste it again in the DNS setting field to trigger a form change so that you can select *Save*. Refer to the xref:access-management-dns.adoc[Configure DNS on Anypoint Private Cloud] section.
+
WARNING: If you cannot access Anypoint Access Management or the platform, refer to https://pce-runbook.kbuild.msap.io/content/2.1.x/installation/setting-user-dns-nfs.html#wrong-setup-of-the-platform-dns[Wrong setup of the platform DNS] to configure DNS via the command line.

. Finally, ensure that the following items are still correctly configured after the update:
