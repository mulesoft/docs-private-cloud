== Before You Begin
Because Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition (Anypoint Platform PCE) upgrades require a working installation, all environment prerequisites should already be met. As long as you (or your infrastructure team) successfully performed all prerequisite tasks listed in xref:prereq-hardware.adoc[Hardware Prerequisites], xref:prereq-software.adoc[Software Prerequisites], and xref:prereq-network.adoc[Network Prerequisites] prior to the installation of Anypoint Platform PCE, your environment can be upgraded successfully.

Refer to the xref:release-notes::pce/anypoint-private-cloud-release-notes.adoc[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition Release Notes] for additional information about upgrading Anypoint Platform PCE to the most recent version.

[WARNING]
You must contact MuleSoft professional services prior to upgrading. MuleSoft professional services must be involved with your upgrade procedure.

== Procedure

The following steps describe how to upgrade Anypoint Platform PCE and the Anypoint Platform PCE infrastructure. 

[NOTE]
====
* During an upgrade, all Anypoint Platform PCE components are updated.
* The upgrade process causes downtime for each node as it is updated.
====

. Perform a backup of your system as described in xref:backup-and-disaster-recovery.adoc[Configure Backup and Restore]. If you are upgrading from an older version that requires multiple intermediate upgrades, you must backup each intermediate version before proceeding to the next.

. Obtain a link to the installer from your customer success representative.

. Use `ssh` to log in to the master node of your cluster.
+
In a 3-node environment, all nodes are master nodes. To find the master nodes in a 6-node environment, run the following command:
+
----
kubectl get node --show-labels | grep gravitational.io/k8s-role=master
----
+
By performing these procedures from the master node, the upgrade scripts are able to update the entire platform.

. Uncompress the application archive:
+
----
tar -xvf anypoint-2.1.0-installer.tar.gz
----

. Navigate to the `anypoint-2.1.0` directory and run the upload script:
+
----
cd anypoint-2.1.0
sudo ./upgrade
----
+
The `sudo ./upgrade` command updates the platform to the current version and restarts each pod in the cluster. Depending on your network configuration, this command may take a while to complete, and produces output similar to the following example:
+
----
-> initializing upload
-> uploading update package
importing anypoint:2.1.0

update operation (d077277f-3c69-4336-82bf-bd8b428ae202) has been started
the cluster is updating in background
----

. When the upgrade finishes, verify that the migration was successful by performing one of the following options:
+
* Run the following command from the node where you performed the upgrade:
+
----
$ sudo gravity enter
$ kubectl get pods
----

. Log in to the Ops Center at the following URL:
+
----
https://{platform-host}:9500
----
+

. Make sure the following items are configured correctly:

** xref:access-management-SMTP.adoc[Configure SMTP in Anypoint Private Cloud]
** xref:access-management-disclaimer.adoc[Configure a Disclaimer for Anypoint Private Cloud]
