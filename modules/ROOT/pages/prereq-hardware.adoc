To ensure the performance and stability of Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition (Anypoint Platform PCE), every node in your Anypoint Platform PCE environment must meet the requirements described in this topic. 

[IMPORTANT]
Before you install Anypoint Platform PCE, your infrastructure team must review each of the following sections and verify that your environment meets the stated disk and device requirements. If needed, contact your MuleSoft representative for assistance.

== Memory and CPU Requirements

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Component |Requirement
|RAM |32 GB
|CPU |8 Cores
|===

[IMPORTANT]
If the stated requirements for Memory and CPU are not met, Anypoint Platform PCE installation will fail. 

For production environments, each node in your configuration must have the following dedicated devices. All devices must be formatted either as *xfs* or *ext4*.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Component |Size|Minimum IOPS|Mount Point|Description
|HDD 2 xref:prereq-hardware#system-state-directory-device[System State Directory Device] | 100 GB |1500|/var/lib/gravity | Stores system configuration and metadata, including databases and packages. Because package sizes can be large, it is important to estimate the minimum size requirements and allocate enough space as a dedicated device before installation.
|HDD 3 xref:prereq-hardware#application-data-device[Application Data Device]| 250 GB |1500|/var/lib/data | Stores application configuration and data. The amount of space required should be at least 250 GB, but can vary depending on your specific use case. It is important to estimate the minimum size requirements and allocate enough space as a dedicated device ahead of time.
|HDD 4 xref:prereq-hardware#docker-device[Docker Device] | 100 GB |3000|/var/lib/gravity/planet/docker | Used by Docker’s overlay storage driver. A minimum of 100GB is required for the overlay directory. Devices with 50GB or less will experience degraded system performance or might not work at all.
|HDD 5 xref:prereq-hardware#etcd-device[Etcd Device] | 20 GB |3000|/var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd | Provides dedicated storage for the distributed database used for cluster coordination.
|/tmp (Installer) | 20 GB |N/A| |
|/ (root) | 10 GB | N/A | | You must have at least 10GB in your home directory to download and unzip the installer file.|
|===

[NOTE]
The space requirements listed in the previous table are based on average use. For environments with heavy traffic, validate the amount of space needed with your Customer Success Manager.

== System State Directory Device

The main purpose of the system state directory device is to store system configuration and metadata, for example, database and packages. As package sizes can be arbitrarily large, it is important to estimate the minimum size requirements and allocate enough space for the dedicated device.

Format this device either as `xfs` or `ext4` and mounted as `/var/lib/gravity`.  

The following shell snippet is provided as an example for mounting the system state directory device using systemd mount files and cannot be used as-is in production. You can also mount the system state directory device by using `/etc/fstab` or some other method. Consult with your system administrator to determine the best way to meet this requirement. If you use the following example to guide this process, make sure to specify the correct device name in two places.

----
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/<device name>
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/gravity
echo -e "[Mount]\nWhat=/dev/<device name>\nWhere=/var/lib/gravity\nType=ext4\n[Install]\nWantedBy=local-fs.target" | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/var-lib-gravity.mount
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable var-lib-gravity.mount
sudo systemctl start var-lib-gravity.mount
----

== Application Data Device

The main purpose of the application data directory device is to store application configuration and data. The minimum amount of space required is 250GB, but your use case might require more. It is important to allocate enough space for the dedicated device.

Format this device either as `xfs` or `ext4` and mounted as `/var/lib/data`. 

The following shell snippet is provided as an example for mounting the application data device using systemd mount files, and cannot be used as-is in production. You can also mount the application data device using `/etc/fstab` or some other method. Consult with your system administrator to determine the best way to meet this requirement. If you use the following example to guide this process, make sure to specify the correct device name in two places.

----
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/<device name>
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/data
echo -e "[Mount]\nWhat=/dev/<device name>\nWhere=/var/lib/data\nType=ext4\n[Install]\nWantedBy=local-fs.target" | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/var-lib-data.mount
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable var-lib-data.mount
sudo systemctl start var-lib-data.mount
----

== Etcd Device

The main purpose of the etcd device is to provide dedicated storage for a distributed database used for cluster coordination. It does not require much space, 20GB is adequate.

Format this device either as `xfs` or `ext4` and mounted as `/var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd`. 

The following shell snippet mounts the etcd device using systemd mount files to the path `/var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd`.

You can also mount the etcd device using `/etc/fstab` or another method. Consult with your system administrator to 
determine the best way to meet this requirement. If you use the following example as a guide for this process, 
specify the correct device name in two places.	

[NOTE]	
Mount this device AFTER you mount the System State device under `/var/lib/gravity/planet`. If you are using systemd units to mount the volumes, declare mount dependencies using `After=<device-name>.<mount>`.

----
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/<device name>
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd
echo -e "[Mount]\nWhat=/dev/<device name>\nWhere=/var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd\nType=ext4\n[Install]\nWantedBy=local-fs.target" | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/var-lib-gravity-planet-etcd.mount
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable var-lib-gravity-planet-etcd.mount
sudo systemctl start var-lib-gravity-planet-etcd.mount
----

== Docker Device

Unless specified, Docker configuration defaults to the use of the overlay driver, which is recommended for production.

Format this device as `xfs` or `ext4` and mounted as `/var/lib/gravity/planet/docker`.

The following example shell snippet mounts the Docker device using systemd mount files to the path:
`/var/lib/gravity/planet/docker`. You can also mount the Docker device using `/etc/fstab` or another method.
Consult with your system administrator to determine the best way to meet this requirement.
If you use the following example as a guide for this process, specify the correct device name in two places.

[NOTE]
Mount this device AFTER you mount the System State device under `/var/lib/gravity/planet`. If you are using system.d units to mount the volumes, declare mount dependencies using `After=<device-name>.<mount>`

----
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/<device name>
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/gravity/planet/docker
echo -e "[Mount]\nWhat=/dev/<device name>\nWhere=/var/lib/gravity/planet/docker\nType=ext4\n[Install]\nWantedBy=local-fs.target" | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/var-lib-gravity-planet-docker.mount
sudo systemctl daemon-reload	
sudo systemctl enable var-lib-gravity-planet-docker.mount
sudo systemctl start var-lib-gravity-planet-docker.mount
----

== Verify Devices

To verify that all devices are set up the same way on all nodes, run the `lsblk` command. Output from `lsblk` should resemble the following example: 

----
[root@ip-0-0-0-0 ~]# lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE  RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0   90G   0 disk
├─xvda1 202:1    0    1M   0 part
└─xvda2 202:2    0   90G   0 part /
xvdb    202:16   0  100G   0 disk /var/lib/gravity/planet/docker
xvdc    202:32   0   20G   0 disk /var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd
xvdd    202:48   0  250G   0 disk /var/lib/data
xvde    202:64   0  100G   0 disk /var/lib/gravity
xvdf    202:64   0   20G   0 disk /tmp
----

== Verify Disk IOPS

Depending on your hardware or virtualization provider, you can configure disk IOPS (I/O operations per second). Using the `iops` command, verify available IOPS on each device:

----
$ sudo ./iops --time 2 /dev/xvdb
/dev/xvdb, 107.37 GB, 32 threads:
 512   B blocks: 1893.0 IO/s, 946.5 KiB/s (  7.8 Mbit/s)
   1 KiB blocks: 1354.8 IO/s,   1.3 MiB/s ( 11.1 Mbit/s)
   2 KiB blocks: 1091.8 IO/s,   2.1 MiB/s ( 17.9 Mbit/s)
   4 KiB blocks:  807.1 IO/s,   3.2 MiB/s ( 26.4 Mbit/s)
   8 KiB blocks:  803.7 IO/s,   6.3 MiB/s ( 52.7 Mbit/s)
  16 KiB blocks:  787.4 IO/s,  12.3 MiB/s (103.2 Mbit/s)
  32 KiB blocks:  700.8 IO/s,  21.9 MiB/s (183.7 Mbit/s)
  64 KiB blocks:  590.0 IO/s,  36.9 MiB/s (309.3 Mbit/s)
 128 KiB blocks:  327.6 IO/s,  40.9 MiB/s (343.5 Mbit/s)
...
----

== Load Balancer Requirements
Anypoint Platform PCE must run in a production environment with multiple servers. To distribute traffic among servers and to restrict access to specific ports, you must provide and configure a load balancer.

You can use any load balancer, including NGINX, but NGINX is not required.

[NOTE]
If using the xref:prereq-aws-terraform.adoc[AWS Provisioner for Anypoint Private Cloud], you do not need to configure a separate load balancer. An Amazon ELB with the required configuration is created during installation.

=== Load Balancer Configuration
You can configure your load balancer to use any method for distributing client requests, but in most contexts a round robin strategy is ideal. The load balancer should be accessible through an IP address that is available to all machines in your network.

Your load balancer must route the following TCP ports:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Load Balancer Port |Instance Port | Internal Usage
|`80` | `30080`  | HTTP redirects to HTTPs
|`443` | `30443` | HTTPS port
|`8083` | `30883` | HTTPS port for Mule runtimes to authenticate and renew certificates
|`8889` | `30889` | WebSocket port for Mule runtimes to connect
|`9500` | `32009` | Ops Center access port
|===

In each case, your load balancer must listen on the load balancer port and redirect incoming requests to the instance port. Your Anypoint Platform PCE installation includes an internal NGINX server that listens on each of the configured instance ports, and then performs the action listed in the Internal Usage column.

Your load balancer should poll the address `HTTP:10248/healthz` to run a health check on your platform servers and confirm that they are accessible.

[NOTE]
Do not configure SSL certificates in your load balancer. TLS termination is handled by the platform with the certificates configured using Access Management. See xref:config-workflow.adoc[Post-installation Tasks].

=== Implement a Load Balancer Using NGINX

. Enable stream block in your `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file by referencing all the configuration properties defined in `/etc/nginx/stream.d/*`.
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
stream {
   include /etc/nginx/stream.d/*.conf;
}
----

. Delete the `default.conf` file from `/etc/nginx/conf.d`
. Create a folder named `/etc/nginx/stream.d` and in it create a file named `onprem.conf`
. Paste the following content in `onprem.conf`
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
server {
   listen 80;
   proxy_pass 0.0.0.0:30080;
}

server {
   listen 443;
   proxy_pass 0.0.0.0:30443;
}

server {	
   listen 8083;	
   proxy_pass 0.0.0.0:30883;	
}

server {
   listen 8889;
   proxy_pass 0.0.0.0:30889;
}

server {
   listen 9500;
   proxy_pass 0.0.0.0:32009;
}

server {
   listen 9501;
   proxy_pass 0.0.0.0:30083;
}
----

. Enable the default ports on SELinux before starting the NGINX. Run the following commands one by one:
+
----
semanage port -a -t http_port_t  -p tcp 8083
semanage port -a -t http_port_t  -p tcp 8889
semanage port -a -t http_port_t  -p tcp 9500
semanage port -a -t http_port_t  -p tcp 9501
----

. Start NGINX:
+
----
service nginx restart
----
