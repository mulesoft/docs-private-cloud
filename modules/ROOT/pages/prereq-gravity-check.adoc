= Verify System Requirements for Anypoint Private Cloud on a Physical Server

After setting up your environment, you can run the `gravity check` script to verify that your system meets the minimum requirements for Anypoint Private Cloud.
How do I know where the gravity binary and app.yaml manifest are? Where do I copy these to on each node? I got command not found. Anything different for 3 node vs 6 node environment???

. Copy the following from the node where you ran the installer to each node of your cluster:
+
* The `gravity` binary.
* The `app.yaml` manifest used by the `gravity` binary.
+
These files are located in the folder of the installer.

. Run the following command from each node of your cluster:
+
----
sudo ./gravity check --profile=app_node app.yaml
----
+
Valid values of the `--profile` option are:
+
* app_node
* data_node
* general_node (for 3 node installations)
* demo_node (for 1 node installations)

If the command returns no output, this indicates that your environment is setup correctly with the required resources. If your environment does not meet the requirements, the command returns a message describing the problem.
