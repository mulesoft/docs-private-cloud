Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition (Anypoint Platform PCE) lets you run and manage Mule apps on your local servers, following your security policies. It offers local control plane functionality, with no external system interactions or internet connectivity required. You maintain all data storage, processing, and transmission.
Anypoint Platform PCE uses Docker and Kubernetes for built-in high availability and scalability. While you can install it without deep Docker or Kubernetes knowledge, understanding these tools is essential for management and troubleshooting.

Anypoint Platform PCE version 4.0 runs on enterprise-ready Kubernetes Openshift, Amazon EKS Anywhere (EKS-A) and Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE2). Additionally, it supports Java 17, in addition to Java 8 and 11.

== Anypoint Platform PCE 4.0 Architecture

The diagram illustrates MuleSoft's planes (control plane and runtime plane) and their general traffic flow within the Anypoint Platform PCE context:

image:pce4-diagram-architecture.png[""]

Control plane:

* A subset of Anypoint services is deployed in Kubernetes (customer's choice - Anypoint Platform PCE v 4.0 supports RKE2, EKS-A, OpenShift).
* This constitutes the MuleSoft Control Plane, a web-based management and administration tool for the lifecycle of MuleSoft Integration apps and APIs.
* Starting with Anypoint Platform PCE v4.0, use a dedicated Kubernetes control plane to separate cluster management components from customer workloads.

Runtime plane:

* MuleSoft offers various runtime planes (CloudHub, CloudHub 2.0, Runtime Fabric, and Hybrid Standalone).
* Within Anypoint Platform PCE context, the test uses the Hybrid runtime plane to deploy and manage runtimes via the MuleSoft control plane.
