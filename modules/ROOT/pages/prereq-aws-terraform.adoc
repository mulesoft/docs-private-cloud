endif::[]

This topic describes how to create the resources required to install Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Anypoint Private Cloud supports 3-node and 6-node configurations in a production environment on AWS.
// When do these instructions need to be performed - this is out of order.  Not needed if starting from bare metal servers - need to add clarification about this in the topic.???

== Prerequisites

To install Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition on AWS, you must have an AWS account with the following:
// What do I do if I don’t know whether an AWS account exists? How do I check permissions and resources? Are resources listed the ‘default’???

* Your account must have AWS keys with EC2FullAccess and S3FullAccess permissions.
* When creating your AWS environment, the following resources are created:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| AWS Resource | Number required (3-node) | Number required (6-node)
| m5.2xlarge | 3 | 6
| root disk @ 500 iops | 3 | 6
| EBS volumes @ 1500 iops | 6 | 12
| EBS volume @ 3000 iops | 6 | 12
| Amazon ELB | 1 | 1
| t2.medium | 1 | 1
|===

== Run the AWS Provisioner

MuleSoft provides a Docker image that you can use to provision the resources for your AWS account. You can also run custom shell scripts on the provisioned instances (see below).

. Create an initial instance (t2.small) on your AWS account on any VPC with internet access.
// How do I create an initial t2.small instance?  How do I manually install Docker? How do I run the provisioner remotely???
+
This instance is used to run the actual provisioning of the cluster. You must use an AMI that has Docker installed by default or you must manually install Docker after creating the AWS instance.
+
You can also run provisioner remotely from any other machine with Docker and internet access.

. Download the Private Cloud Provisioner (PCP) Docker image from the following URL:
+
----
https://anypoint-anywhere.s3.amazonaws.com/pcp/pcp-1.0.tar.gz?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAI6LBJNQFR2V3CQWQ&Expires=1712193983&Signature=noiRGBIBJtwsMLQxTux%2FiM%2F5SP0%3D
----

Copy the provisioner Docker image to the instance via SCP

----
scp -i <guest>.pem ~/Downloads/pce-2.0-aws-provisioner.gz ec2-user@18.221.155.87:/home/ec2-user
----
// How do I know what <guest>.pem is???

. SSH into the instance
+
----
ssh -i 'anypoint.pem' ec2-user@18.221.155.87
----

. Create the var file (pce.env) with the environment details using the template below:
// How do I create the var file pce.env? How do I get environment info to be able to set up pce.env? Need descriptions for all parms???

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Description
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | Specifies the AWS access ID Terraform uses to connect to your AWS account
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | Specifies the AWS access key Terraform uses to connect to your AWS account
| AWS_KEY_NAME | Specifies the AWS SSH key. Do not include the .pem extension.
| AWS_REGION | Specifies the AWS region where Terraform creates the cluster. For example: `us-east-2`. Must have the same value as AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.
| AWS_DEFAULT_REGION | Same as above. Must have the same value as AWS_REGION
| TF_VAR_ssh_user=<SSH_USER> | Specifies the ssh user. For example: `ec2-user`, `centos`, etc)
| CLOUD_PROVIDER | Must be `aws`
| CLUSTER_TYPE | Must be `pce`

|===

You can also include the following set of optional environment variables:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Description
| TF_VAR_ami_name | Enables you to specify the name of the AMI to be used for the instances. Use the AMI name and NOT the AMI Id. If you do not set this variable, the provisioner uses the folowing AMI by default: `RHEL-7.4_HVM_GA-20170808-x86_64-2-Hourly2-GP2`
| TF_VAR_monitoring=<true or false> | If true it will create basic instance alarms in Cloudwatch.
| TF_VAR_use_bastion=<true or false> | If true it will create a small instance (using an ASG) in a public subnet as a jumpbox and associate a public IP address, and launch the cluster instances in the private subnets
| TF_VAR_internal=<true or false> | If true the cluster instances will be launched in private subnets and will not have public ips associated with them. Also, the provisioned load balancer will be internal only
| AWS_VPC_ID=<VPC_ID> | Specifies an existing VPC. It should already have an internet gateway attached to it. Subnets will still be provisioned within the existing VPC
| AWS_VPC_CIDR=<VPC_CIDR> | You can pass a preferred CIDR for the new VPC that will be provisioned. (Requires not to pass a AWS_VPC_ID)
| TF_VAR_aws_selected_subnets_ids=<SUBNETS_IDS> | You can pass a list of subnets IDs where the instances will be launched on. If you reuse your own subnets, you need to set up Route Tables, NAT Gateways and Internet Gateway. For example: `["subnet-0a17317984065f98f", "subnet-0600b4befb27c7949", "subnet-02103e0c935eff75a"]`
| TF_VAR_subnets=<PRIVATE_SUBNETS_CIDRs> | You can optionally pass the preferred CIDRs blocks for the NEW subnets that will be provisioned. You must pass exactly the minimum number between the number of AZs of the region and the number of nodes you selected for your cluster. For example: `'["10.1.0.0/24", "10.1.1.0/24", "10.1.2.0/24"]'`
| TF_VAR_public_subnets=<PUBLIC_SUBNETS_CIDRs> | You can optionally pass the preferred CIDRs blocks for the NEW subnets that will be provisioned. You must pass exactly the minimum number between the number of AZs of the region and the number of nodes you selected for your cluster. For example: `'["10.1.3.0/24", "10.1.4.0/24", "10.1.5.0/24"]'`
| TF_VAR_role_tag_value=<AWS_TAG_VALUE_FOR_ROLE_LABEL> | You can provide a value for a ROLE tag that all AWS resources will have
|===

. Load the provisioner Docker image into the local Docker registry:
+
----
docker load -i pce2.0-aws-provisioner.gz
----

. Record the image ID after running the `docker load` command. This is required in the following step.
// Can we provide and image ID example? Will ‘docker load’ command be available at this point? What if this fails???

. Perform a dry-run
+
----
docker run --rm --env-file pce.env IMAGE_ID dry-run
----
+

.  Run the provisioner
// What do I do if the provisioner fails? Check this on all nodes???
+
----
docker run --rm --env-file pce.env IMAGE_ID cluster-provision
----
+
After the provisioner runs successfully, it displays information about your environment including IP addresses, DNS name of the load balancer, etc.

. Verify that the provisioning script ran successfully by checking the existence of /var/lib/bootstrap_complete on the instances

== Custom provisioning scripts (Optional)
// How do I know if I have custom shell scripts? Where do I get passwords for the volume mount???

You can have your own shell scripts to run on the provisioned instances before and/or after the PCE provisioner scripts. In order to do so, place your shell scripts with .sh extension inside a folder named `pre-user-data` and/or `post-user-data`. Finally include the following volume mounts on the docker run command:

----
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/pre-user-data:/usr/local/bin/provisioner/terraform/external/pre-user-data -v $(pwd)/post-user-data:/usr/local/bin/provisioner/terraform/external/post-user-data --env-file pce.env IMAGE_ID cluster-provision
----

== Open Port 61009 Before Installation (Optional)
// Is this optional. Feedback received says this is needed for the person doing the installation.??? How do I open port 61009???

If you are installing Anypoint Private Cloud Edition using the GUI-based installer, you must enable this port before running the installer. You must open this port to the world in the cluster's security group before running the installer using AWS Web Console.

== Install Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition

After provisioning resources in your AWS environment and uploading the installer to one of the nodes, install Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition using one of the installers:
// How do I upload the installer to one of the nodes? (or did we do this already)? Does it matter which node???

* xref:install-installer.adoc[To Install Anypoint Private Cloud using the GUI Installer]
* xref:install-auto-install.adoc[To Install Anypoint Private Cloud using the Command Line Installer]

== Disabling Port 61009 After Installation

After installation is finished you can close port 61009 in the cluster security group using the AWS Web console.

== Troubleshooting

* 403 Forbidden

Check that your keys policies are not denying access to any EC2 or S3 resource. You should be able to run the following basic command using AWS CLI with your keys:
// What do I do if key policies are denying access to ec2 or S3 resources???

----
aws sts get-caller-identity
----

* Limit exceeded

The AWS account might have some limits set on the amount of the resources you can create. Delete some unused resources or request a limit increase on from AWS.

* AMI not found
//How do I safely delete unused resources or request a limit increase on AWS? How do I get the AMI name? When do I need to install Terraform? What do I need to know about Linux Bastion Hosts???

Make sure you are using the AMI name as the value for the environment variable and not the ID.
