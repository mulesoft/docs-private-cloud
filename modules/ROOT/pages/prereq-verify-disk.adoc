== Installing Logical Volume Manager 2 (LVM2)
//This is confusing here - section is titled 'Verify' and this is an installation step. Where should this go???

To install and run Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, you must install and use LVM2. LVM2 is a tool that adds a layer of abstraction between your operating system and the disks/partitions it uses. You must have root access to install LVM2.

You can install LVM using Yum. Yum is an open-source command-line package-management utility for Linux operating systems using the RPM Package Manager. Using Yum, you can install LVM through the following command:

----
sudo yum install lvm2
----
// What should I do if this fails???
