[IMPORTANT]
Before you install Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition (Anypoint Platform PCE), your infrastructure team must review each of the following sections and verify that your environment meets the stated requirements. If needed, contact your MuleSoft representative for assistance to ensure your NFS server is configured correctly.

== Verify NFS Server Setup
Anypoint Platform PCE version 2.0 and later requires a Network File System (NFS) server and an available NFS endpoint. Your NFS server must meet the following requirements:

* Must be running on a filesystem that has at least 250 GB available.
* Must be using NFS 4.0.
* Can be backed by a network-attached storage (NAS) system.
* Must have port 2049 enabled for both TCP and UDP.
* Configure your network so that all of the PCE nodes can access the NFS server. The direct NFS client is Kubernetes 1.9 and requires conformance with NFS version 4.

NFS 4.0 does not use the `portmapper` service.

== Verify Required Port Is Open

The NFS server requires port 2049 to be open for TCP and UDP.
 
On each node, use netcat or a similar utility to verify that the required port is open. Netcat is a computer networking utility used to read and write to network connections using TCP or UDP. 

On each node, run: `nc -zv <host_name> 2049`

[NOTE]
By default, the netcat tool is not included with Anypoint Platform PCE. If you receive a `command not found` error, you can download and install netcat or a similar utility.

When the responses from netcat are successful, you receive a response similar to the following example:

----
[ec2-user@ip-10-1-1-97 ~]$ nc -zv <nfs_host_name> 2049
Ncat: Version 7.50 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Connected to 10.1.0.155:2049.
Ncat: 0 bytes sent, 0 bytes received in 0.01 seconds.
----

== Verify NFS Server Is Mounted

On each node, mount the NFS server in a temporary directory. 

. Switch to root: +
`sudo su`
. To mount the NFS in a temporary directory, run the following commands and replace both the `<nfs-server>` and the `<nfs-path>` with your own values: +
`mkdir -p /mnt/home` +
`mount -t nfs4 -o proto=tcp,port=2049 <nfs-server>:<path> /mnt/home/` +
If the mount fails, you do not have the required permissions.

== Verify NFS Performance

Perform careful analysis of your environment, both from the client and server point of view for optimal NFS performance. This involves:

* Testing the performance and latency of your NFS server. Specifically, these operations will transfer data from the client (Anypoint Platform PCE environment) to the NFS server and measure how long each transfer takes.
* Using the command `time dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/home/<nameOfFile> bs=<blockSize> count=<amountOfBlocks>` to test NFS server performance while transferring files and specifying the following parameters: +
** Names `<nameOfFile>` 
** Block size and number of blocks in the transfer: `<blockSize>` and `<amountOfBlocks>`, respectively.
* Validating how Anypoint Platform PCE handles NFS file transfers. Perform read and write operations with both large (128MB) and small (80KB) files.

Perform all tests on each node.

=== Test Writing and Reading Large Files on the NFS Server

Perform the following read and write tests using large files:

* File size: 128 MB
* Block size: 4 KB
* Number of blocks: 32768  

While the tests are running, different files are generated (one file per test).

. Create a directory in which to mount the NFS server: 
+
----
sudo su
mkdir -p /mnt/home
----
. Mount the NFS server: 
+ 
----
mount -t nfs4 -o proto=tcp,port=2049 <nfs-server>:<path> /mnt/home/
----
. Perform writes (five files of 128 MB each) on the NFS server: 
+
----
time for i in {1..5}; do dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/home/greatfile$i.test bs=4k count=32768; done
----
+
The command output is similar to the following:
+
----
[root@ip-10-1-1-97 ec2-user]# time for i in {1..5}; do dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/home/greatfile$i.test bs=4k count=32768; done
32768+0 records in
32768+0 records out
134217728 bytes (134 MB) copied, 2.12805 s, 63.1 MB/s
.
.
.
real 0m8.378s
user 0m0.034s
sys 0m0.792s
----
+
The `real` parameter in the test output should be less than 15 seconds. 

==== Validate Read Performance

. Unmount the NFS server: 
+
----
umount /mnt/home
----
. Remount the NFS server: 
+
----
mount -t nfs4 -o proto=tcp,port=2049 <nfs-server>:<path> /mnt/home/
----
. Perform reads from the NFS server by running the following command: 
+
----
time for i in {1..5}; do dd if=/mnt/home/greatfile$i.test of=/dev/null bs=4k; done
----
+
The `real` parameter in the test output should be less than 15 seconds.

==== Clear the Caches 

Unmount the NFS server to clear out any caches:

----
umount /mnt/home
----

=== Test Writing and Reading Small Files on the NFS Server

Test small files as you did large files but with these sizes:

 * File size: 80 KB 
 * Block size: 4 KB
 * Number of blocks: 20
 
Before starting the test, verify that the `/mnt/home` directory from the previous test is created.

. Mount the NFS server: 
+   
----
mount -t nfs4 -o proto=tcp,port=2049 <nfs-server>:<path> /mnt/home/
----
. Perform writes (five files of 80 KB each) on the NFS server: 
+
----
time for i in {1..30}; do dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/home/smallfile$i.test bs=4k count=20; done
----
+
The `real` parameter in the test output should be around 2 seconds.

==== Validate Read Performance

. Unmount the NFS server: 
+
----
umount <nfs-server>
----
. Remount the NFS server: 
+
----
mount -t nfs4 -o proto=tcp,port=2049 <nfs-server>:<path> /mnt/home/
----
. Perform reads from the NFS server: 
+
----
time for i in {1..30}; do dd if=/mnt/home/smallfile$i.test of=/dev/null bs=4k; done
----
+
The important parameter in the test output is the `real` parameter, which should be around 2 seconds.

==== Delete the Test Files

When you finish the performance testing, delete the test files. 

. Remove all generated files by running: 
+
----
rm -f /mnt/home/*.test
----
. Unmount the NFS server: 
+
----
umount /mnt/home
----
