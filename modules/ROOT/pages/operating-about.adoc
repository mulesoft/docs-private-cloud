After your installation is complete, your instance of Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition (Anypoint Platform PCE) is ready to use. Users registered in your external identity service should have access to your Anypoint platform xref:access-management::organization.adoc[organization]. As an admin, you can add xref:access-management::roles.adoc[roles] to these users. 

You can also xref:runtime-manager::managing-servers.adoc[register servers] so that you can then xref:runtime-manager::deploying-to-your-own-servers.adoc[deploy to them], and so on.

Mule app developers in your organization who create Mule apps through the xref:studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio] IDE must set up their editors so the Mule apps interface with your locally installed Anypoint Platform rather than the default cloud Anypoint Platform. 

The following topics describe how to manage Anypoint Platform PCE after installation and configuration is complete:

* Close port 61009 in the cluster security group. If you are using AWS, you can use the AWS Management Console to do this.
