Because Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition (Anypoint Platform PCE) does not provide an SMTP server, you must set up your own SMTP email server to deliver email alerts generated by API Manager and Runtime Manager. The SMTP email server also sends email messages for platform infrastructure alerts, including CPU, memory, and disk alerts.

You must direct your local installation of Anypoint Platform PCE to this server from the Access Management panel. 

[NOTE]
Only SMTP servers with Authentication are supported (anonymous SMTP relay servers are not supported). +
SMTPS is not supported.
