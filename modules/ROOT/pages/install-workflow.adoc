After your infrastructure team verifies that the required infrastructure has been correctly installed and configured as described in xref:install-checklist[Product Prerequisites], upload the installation package to all nodes in your environment and select one node from which to run the installation. You can then install Anypoint Platform Private Cloud using one of the following installers: 

* xref:install-installer.adoc[Run the GUI installer]
* xref:install-auto-install.adoc[Run the CLI installer]

The GUI installer is interactive and walks you through a set of wizard pages that enable you to specify configuration options, but it also requires you to open extra ports and a web browser to access the pages.

The CLI installer does not require human interaction using a web browser and is useful for automation.
