= Allow Addresses for API Platform Proxies
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

By default, proxy requests are enabled for the domain name where the platform is running.

To allow addresses:

. Log in to Ops Center and select Configuration.
. Select the `api-platform-web-config` config map from the drop-down list.
. Locate the `features` object in the local.js tab:
+
----
features: {
    alerts:             false,
    analytics:          false,
    cloudHubDeployment: false,
    hybridDeployment:   true,
    segmentio:          false,
    proxyWhitelist:     true
  }
----

. Ensure that the `proxyWhitelist` property is set to `true`.
. Locate the `proxyWhitelist` object in the same tab.
+
----
proxyWhitelist: {
    allowLocalhost: false,
    allowPlatformHost: true,
    rules: []
  }
----
+
The `proxyWhitelist` object contains the following properties:
+
[cols="2*a"]
|===
| allowLocalhost | Enables proxy requests to be made to the `localhost` address.
| allowPlatformHost | Enables proxy requests to be made to the same domain where the platform is hosted.
| rules | Defines an array containing regular expressions to create matching rules.
|===

. Update the `rules` array as necessary. The following example shows how to define regular expressions to allow requests to be made to the `*.somewhere.com/*` and `*.somewhereelse.com/*` domains, where * is any part of a DNS name or URL:
+
----
proxyWhitelist: {
    allowLocalhost: false,
    allowPlatformHost: true,
    rules: [
        /.*\.somewhere\.com/,
        /.*\.somewhereelse\.com/
    ]
  }
----

. Select Apply to save changes to the `api-platform-web-config` config map.
. Recreate the pod to ensure each node in the cluster uses the most current configuration:
+
----
kubectl delete pod -l microservice=api-platform-web
----
