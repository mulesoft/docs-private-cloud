= Allow Addresses for API Platform Proxies
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

By default, proxy requests are enabled for the domain name where the platform is running.

To allow addresses:

. Log in to Ops Center and select *Kubernetes* on the left side-bar.
. Select the `api-manager` namespace from the drop-down menu on the top, and then select *Configmaps*. Find the `api-platform-web-env` configmap and then click on `Edit Config Map`.
. Select the *APW_FEATURES_PROXYWHITELIST* tab and ensure that value is set to `true`. (You'll have to hover your mouse over the tabs to get a tooltip with the full name to find the right tab)
+
If not, set it to `true` and then select `Apply`.
. Select the *APW_PROXYWHITELIST_RULES* tab.
. Write your rules separated by commas.
+
The following example defines regular expressions that allow requests to be made to the `*.somewhere.com/*` and `*.somewhereelse.com/*` domains, where `*` is any part of a DNS name or URL:

----
.*\.somewhere\.com,.*\.somewhereelse\.com
----

. Select *Apply* to save changes to the `api-platform-web-env` config map.
. Re-create the pods to ensure that each node in the cluster uses the most recent configuration:
+
----
kubectl delete pod -n api-manager -l component=api-platform-web
----
