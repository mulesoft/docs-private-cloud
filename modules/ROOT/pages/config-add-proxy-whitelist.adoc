= Add Allowlist Addresses for API Platform Proxies
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

By default, proxy requests are enabled for the domain name where the platform is running.

To add allowlist addresses:

. Log in to Ops Center and select *Configuration*.
. Select the `api-manager` namespace from the right drop-down menu and then select the `api-platform-web-env` config map from the left drop-down menu.
. Select *APW_FEATURES_PROXYWHITELIST* and ensure that value is set to `true`. 
+
If not, set it to `true` and then select `Apply`.
. Select *APW_PROXYWHITELIST_RULES*.
. Write your rules separated by commas.
+
The following example defines regular expressions that allow requests to be made to the `*.somewhere.com/*` and `*.somewhereelse.com/*` domains, where `*` is any part of a DNS name or URL:

----
.*\.somewhere\.com,.*\.somewhereelse\.com 
----

. Select *Apply* to save changes to the `api-platform-web-env` config map.
. Re-create the pods to ensure that each node in the cluster uses the most recent configuration:
+
----
kubectl delete pod -n api-manager -l component=api-platform-web
----
